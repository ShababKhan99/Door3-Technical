This technical creates a book store CRUD application, which I saw more as an encyclopedia for auhtors and their books. The application allows from all CRUD possibilities, and has multiple pages, such as Author page with a list of authors, and a Book page with a list of all books. These pages navigate then to the singular author and book pages. The application also has a simple navbar from the react component library MaterialUi. The database is a PostgreSQL database as well, with a Node.JS backend, and React.JS frontend.

## How to run the app

You must have a bash terminal of your choosing open for both backend and frontend folders, and 
`npm install`
if not done already previously. After having the terminal open  for both folders, start by running 
`npm start`
for the backend, and then do the same for the frontend folder, and the app should open right up.
